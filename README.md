# This Repo is Residency Day 1: Project Deliverable 1: Data Collection, Cleaning, and Exploration MSCS-634-M20 

## Data Collection, Cleaning, and Exploratory Data Analysis  

### Dataset Overview
For this project, the dataset chosen is the **Passenger Travel Facts and Figures** provided by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS). This dataset contains historical statistics on passenger travel across the United States, including metrics such as passenger miles, number of trips, and mode-specific travel data. The dataset contains over 500 records and multiple attributes, including `Year`, `Mode`, `Statistic`, `Value`, and `Name`. It provides sufficient diversity and depth to perform comprehensive exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and to support regression, classification, and clustering tasks in subsequent deliverables. The dataset is publicly available from the BTS portal and is well-suited for demonstrating data mining techniques in a real-world context.

### Data Cleaning
The first step in preparing the dataset for analysis was to ensure consistency in column names by removing any leading or trailing spaces. This is particularly important for government datasets, which often include formatting inconsistencies that can cause errors in code execution. After standardizing the column names, missing values were addressed. Rows missing critical information, such as `Year` or `Value`, were removed since they do not contribute meaningful information for analysis. For categorical columns like `Mode` and `Statistic`, any missing values were filled with "Unknown" to retain as much usable data as possible. Duplicate records were also removed to prevent redundancy from skewing analysis or modeling results. Finally, the `Year` and `Value` columns were converted to numeric types to facilitate mathematical operations and visualizations. Extreme values were handled using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to remove outliers that could distort summary statistics and affect model performance.

### Feature Engineering
After cleaning, the dataset was enhanced with additional features to provide more analytical value. A binary feature, `High_Travel_Year`, was created to indicate whether the `Value` of a particular record exceeded the median, essentially classifying years into high or low travel activity. This feature is particularly useful for future classification tasks. Additionally, a `Value_Change` feature was calculated to capture the year-over-year difference in travel metrics for each transportation mode. This temporal feature allows for the identification of trends and changes in travel behavior over time, which is valuable for regression and clustering analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Exploratory data analysis revealed several key trends in passenger travel. Line plots of `Value` against `Year` showed a general increase in travel metrics over time, with occasional drops likely due to external events such as economic recessions or disruptions in transportation systems. The distribution of `Value` was right-skewed, indicating that a few years or modes experienced unusually high travel activity compared to the rest of the dataset. Analysis by transportation mode demonstrated that highway travel dominates overall passenger activity, while air and rail travel are more variable and less consistent. Year-over-year change analysis highlighted that some modes, such as highways, exhibit steady growth, whereas modes like rail or air have fluctuating growth patterns. Correlation analysis among numeric columns confirmed that `Value` is strongly related to `Value_Change`, while categorical variables like `Mode` and `Statistic` provide further differentiation for analysis.

### Key Insights
From the cleaning, feature engineering, and EDA, several key insights emerged. First, passenger travel in the U.S. generally increases over time, though specific modes may experience drops in certain years. Second, travel patterns vary significantly by mode, with highway travel consistently dominating while other modes display high variability. Third, the right-skewed distribution and presence of outliers highlight the need for careful handling in modeling. Fourth, the newly created features, such as `High_Travel_Year` and `Value_Change`, provide meaningful predictors for classification and regression tasks. Finally, both the transportation mode and year are strong determinants of travel activity, offering a foundation for future modeling efforts.

### Challenges and Considerations
During the data cleaning and EDA process, several challenges were encountered. The presence of multiple columns representing years (`Year`, `Year `, `Year 1`) required careful selection and standardization to avoid ambiguity. Missing values in both numeric and categorical columns had to be managed to maximize usable data while maintaining integrity. The dataset also exhibited skewed distributions and extreme values, which required careful outlier treatment. These challenges were addressed through systematic cleaning, feature engineering, and data standardization, ensuring that the dataset is now robust and ready for further analysis in regression, classification, clustering, and pattern mining.

### Conclusion
Deliverable 1 successfully prepared the Passenger Travel Facts and Figures dataset for advanced data mining tasks. The cleaning and feature engineering steps ensured data consistency and completeness, while exploratory analysis revealed patterns, trends, and insights that will guide the development of predictive and clustering models in subsequent project phases. This foundation enables more accurate modeling and meaningful insights into passenger travel behavior in the United States.
